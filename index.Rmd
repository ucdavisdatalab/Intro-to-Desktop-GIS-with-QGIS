# Overview {-}

## Workshop Description
This introductory-level workshop will focus upon the fundamental concepts and skills needed to explore and analyze data using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software with examples using the QGIS platform.

## Prerequisites
No prior experience with QGIS or other GIS software is needed, though attendees should be comfortable learning new computer applications, working with the basics of spreadsheets, and managing, organizing, and moving computer files on their operating system.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

Define GIS and geospatial concepts and terminology.
Know the difference between vector and raster data types
Properly connect and add data to a QGIS project
Know where to find the attributes of your data in QGIS
Perform basic selections and queries in QGIS
Symbolize data by attributes
Assemble a basic map for export
