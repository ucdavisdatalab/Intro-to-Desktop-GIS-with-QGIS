# Saving Project Files
Now that we've added data to our project, let's save it so we can come back to it later.  

1. Click on the blue floppy disk icon (or from the *File* menu, select *Save*).
1. Navigate to where you want to save your project file. 
1. In the *File name* box, type the name you would like your file to have.  Give it a descriptive name so you'll remember what the file was for.
1. Click *Save*.

Note for ESRI users: QGIS' .qgs and .qgz file are analogous to ArcMap's .mxd files.
